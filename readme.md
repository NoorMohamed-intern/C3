hi
i am M.Noor mohamed,selected for the next round in C3 internship.
I was instructed to make a sample admin page.
In the given time of approx 48 hours,i Knew if i would'nt have enough time to make a beautiful site.So i sticked to my basics and build a bootstrap one.I could have written more CSS.But i Did not want to make it half-baked.

//JS
I implented Jquery,i know it is out of trend now-a-days,But i just wanted it for simple graphs,animations,etc..

//CSS
Couple of BS files and a style css for custom styling

//Index
All websites sections,div are all in single main file.
Side navbar is an inspiration from your Dashboard Copy files.

I know it is very simple.But i made sure i did'nt want to complicate anything and stick to my basics.To finish it before deadline.
Thank you C3 for this challenge!
